## Drones

:scroll: **START**


### Introduction

This project is the first initial proof of concept (POC) developed for an IOT Backend written in FastAPI and Python Core  

---

### Task description

We have a fleet of **10 drones**. A drone is capable of carrying devices, other than cameras, and capable of delivering small loads. For our use case **the load is medications**.

A **Drone** has:
- serial number (100 characters max);
- model (Lightweight, Middleweight, Cruiserweight, Heavyweight);
- weight limit (500gr max);
- battery capacity (percentage);
- state (IDLE, LOADING, LOADED, DELIVERING, DELIVERED, RETURNING).

Each **Medication** has: 
- name (allowed only letters, numbers, ‘-‘, ‘_’);
- weight;
- code (allowed only upper case letters, underscore and numbers);
- image (picture of the medication case).

Develop a service via REST API that allows clients to communicate with the drones (i.e. **dispatch controller**). The specific communicaiton with the drone is outside the scope of this task. 

The service should allow:
- registering a drone;
- loading a drone with medication items;
- checking loaded medication items for a given drone; 
- checking available drones for loading;
- check drone battery level for a given drone;

> Feel free to make assumptions for the design approach.

### Requirements

While implementing your solution **please take care of the following requirements**: 

#### Functional requirements

- There is no need for UI;
- Prevent the drone from being loaded with more weight that it can carry;
- Prevent the drone from being in LOADING state if the battery level is **below 25%**;
- Introduce a periodic task to check drones battery levels and create history/audit event log for this.

This is a part of a more complex IOT backend sytem which has been modelled for simplicity here.
